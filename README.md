# riemann-rs

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/summa-tx/riemann-rs/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/summa-tx/riemann-rs?branch=master)

`riemann-rs` is a set of transaction construction libraries for UTXO-based
chains. It aims to provide high-quality tooling for constructing
transactions, and to enable use in the browser via wasm bindings.

## Project Status

While this is feature-complete, and there are some tests, **this is essentially
alpha software**. There will be rough edges, and the interfaces are subject to
change.

Specificallly:
- `core` and `bitcoin` are RC1.
- `bip32`
  - wasm features are awaiting parity secp version bump.
  - libsecp (default) features are RC1.
  - the backends will eventually be broken into a separate module.
- `bitcoin-wasm` is near-ready, but some `bitcoin` functionality is not yet
  exposed.
- `psbt` is early alpha.

## Project Architecture

The project is built around the `coins-core` crate which defines high-level
traits and interfaces. Chain-specific libraries use these traits to provide
a consistent developer experience across chains.

We have provided a `bitcoins` crate with a Bitcoin-targeted implementation. See
its documentation for usage instruction and details. We have also provided wasm
bindings to `bitcoins` via `wasm-bindgen`.

`bitcoins-bip32` provides tooling for BIP32 HDKey derivation, and
`bitcoins-psbt` implements the BIP174 partially-signed transaction format.

## Getting started

If building a Rust app, use `bitcoins` in the `./bitcoin/` directory. If
building for a browser, use `bitcoins-wasm` in the `./bitcoin-wasm/` directory.

Once there, you can build and view the documentation using
`$ cargo rustdoc --open`.


## Building & running tests

- install [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)
- Run _all_ the tests `$ ./build.sh`
- build the docs: `$ cargo rustdoc`

## Implementing a new chain

This is a high-level guide to implementing a library for a new chain.

### Implementing Inputs
An input consumes some TXO referenced by its ID.

1. Select or create a struct to be your `TXOIdentifier`
  1. This is the unique in-protocol identifier for a TXO.
  1. In Bitcoin this is `bitcoins::types::txin::BitcoinOutpoint`.
  1. Add the marker trait: `impl riemann_core::types::tx::TXOIdentifier`
1. Implement a type to be your `Input`
  1. This represents the input TXOs consumed by a transaction.
  1. This could be the same as `TXOIdentifier`, depending on your protocol.
  1. In Bitcoin this is `bitcoins::types::txin::BitcoinInput`.
  1. Add the marker trait: `impl riemann_core::types::tx::Input`
  1. Associate your `TXOIdentifier` type

### Implementing Outputs
An output creates a new TXO with some value owned by some payee.

1. Select or create a struct to be your `RecipientIdentifier`
  1. This is used to identify payees in-protocol.
  1. In Bitcoin this is `bitcoins::types::script::ScriptPubkey`
  1. `impl riemann_core::types::tx::RecipientIdentifier` on your struct
1. Select or create a type to be your `Value`
  1. This type represents how the in-protocol value of a TXO.
  1. In Bitcoin this is `u64`.
  1. In Ethereum-based TXO chains this is often a `U256` struct.
  1. `impl riemann_core::types::tx::Value` on your struct.
1. Implement a type to be your `Output`
  1. This represents the output TXOs created by a transaction.
  1. In Bitcoin this is `bitcoins::types::txout::BitcoinInput`.
  1. Add the trait: `impl riemann_core::types::tx::Output`
  1. Associate your `Value` and `RecipientIdentifier` types.

### Implementing Transactions
A transaction is a list of inputs and outputs. It provides methods to access
its properties, as well as calculate its signature hash.

1. Define the hash function used by your TX:
  1. We do this so that your TX can use arbitray hashes, while keeping
    type safety.
  1. Define a `Digest` type that represents the output of your hash functions.
    1. Bitcoin uses `[u8; 32]`
  1. Define a `MarkedDigest` type (see `riemann_core::hashes::marked`) for your
    TXIDs.
  1. Define a `MarkedDigestWriter` type that can output `Digest` and
    `MarkedDigest` types.
    1. This must implement `std::io::Write`.
    1. Bitcoin uses `riemann_core::hashes::hash256::Hash256Writer`
1. Define an `Error` type to handle your errors.
  1. This should contain any errors that can occur while interacting with your
    transaction.
  1. See `bitcoins::types::transactions::TxError` for an example.
1. Define a `SighashArgs` type for your transaction.
  1. This struct should carry all the information needed to calculate the hash
    of your transaction that is signed.
1. Define a `Transaction` struct.
1. `impl riemann_core::ser::Ser` on your `Transaction`.
  1. If necessary, create a new `Error` type (see an example in
      `bitcoin/types/transaction.rs`)
  1. This ensures that your tx can be serialized easily.
  1. It is used in the default txid implementation.
1. `impl riemann_core::types::tx::Transaction` on your `Transaction`
  1. Associate your `Error`, `Digest`, `HashWriter`, `TXID`, `SighashArgs`,
   `Input`, and `Output` types.
  1. This is a simple interface for accessing inputs, outputs, and other tx
    info.
  1. If your transaction type does not have a version or a locktime, you may
    implement these as NOPs.

### Implementing the Encoder

An `AddressEncoder` tranlates between protocol-facing, and human-facing
datastructures. Typically this means managing the relationship between
addresses and their in-protocol counterparts.

1. Define an `Error` type. It's fine to reuse a previouse `Error` here.
1. Create a type to be your `Address`
  1. This represents the human-facing payee, and can be translated to a
    `RecipientIdentifier`
  1. In Bitcoin this is an enum wrapper around a `String`.
1. Create a type to be your `Encoder`
1. `impl riemann_core::enc::AddressEncoder` on your `Encoder`
  1. `encode_address` transforms a `RecipientIdentifier` to an `Address`.
  1. `decode_address` transforms an `Address` to a `RecipientIdentifier`.
  1. `string_to_address` transforms a `&str` to an `Address`
  1. Associate your `Address`, `RecipientIdentifier`, and `EncoderError` types.

### Implementing a Builder
1. Create a struct to be your `Builder`.
1. `impl riemann_core::builder::TxBuilder` for your `Builder` type
  1. Associate your `Transaction` and `AddressEncoder` from previous steps.
  1. Feel free to leave `version` and `locktime` as NOPs if unsupported by your
    protocol.

### Implementing a Network

The `Network` ensures type consistency across all previous types. For example,
it guarantees that your `Encoder`, `Builder`, and `TxOut` use the same
`RecipientIdentifier`.

1. Define a new `Error` type. It's fine to reuse a previous `Error` here.
1. Define a `Network` type.
1. `impl riemann_core::nets::Network` on your `Network`.
  1. Associate your `Error` type.
  1. Associate your `TxIn`, `TxOut`, and `Transaction` types from previous steps.
  1. Associate your `Address`, `RecipientIdentifier`, and `AddressEncoder`
    types.
  1. Associate your `Builder` type.
