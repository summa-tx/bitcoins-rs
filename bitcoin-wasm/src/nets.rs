//! The `bitcoin::nets` module cotains Bitcoin network definitions. These are the main interface
//! for accessing the library.
//!
//! Expected user flow is to import the network and access the transaction builder through it.
//! This gives the user immediate access to the full bitcoin toolchain via a single import.
