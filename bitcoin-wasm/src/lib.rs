//! Riemann Bitcoin with wasm-bindings. This crate puts JS-friendly wrappers around the
//! rmn-btc crate. The wrappers implement passthrough methods for most functionality, and the
//! resulting wasm libraries can be run in a browser and in node.js.
//!
//!
//! **This crate is under active development, and the API may change.**
//!
//! The interface aims to be as faithful to `riemann-bitcoin` as possible, however
//! a few compromises have been made.
//!
//! - Crossing the WASM/JS barrier has generally been implemented as `clone()`.
//!   This prevents unsafe use of the WASM memory. This means that most structs are
//!   de facto passed by value.
//!   - example: `vin.push(txin)` clones the txin. Further modifications to `txin`
//!     will not be propagated to the clone in the `Vin`.
//!   - example: `let txin = vin.get(0)` will clone the txin before returning it.
//!     Modifying that `txin`  will not modify the original copy in the vin.
//!     Instead you must make the modifications, and then call `vin.set(0, txin)`.
//! - `Script`, `ScriptPubkey`, and `ScriptSig` are represented as `Uint8Array`s
//!   until we get around to implementing a wrapper type.
//! - `wasm-bindgen` does not seem to support indexing getters and setters on rust
//!   objects, so `.get()` and `.set()` methods have been provided
//! - We have not yet implemented iterator support.
//!
//! ## Interface
//!
//! You should use the standard network interface:
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! const btc = require('@summa-tx/rmn-btc-wasm');
//!
//! const addr = "bc1q....";
//!
//! let tx = btc.BitcoinMainnet.tx_builder()
//!     .version(2)
//!     .spend(btc.BitcoinOutpoint.null(), 0xfffffffd)
//!     .pay(3000000n, addr)
//!     .locktime(0x87878787)
//!     .build();
//! ```
